## Trying it out

This my first "_project_" build with VueJS one of the most popular Javascript framework for building user interfaces. Since i started
learning javascript my go to framework has always been React, ive been using it for a long while i can't imagine myself developing frontend
stuff without it. But i felt like i was living in a bubble, there more to frontend development than just react and theres huge ecosystems
out there to be explored. I'm an kind of an adventurer myself so i decided to have some fun with Vue.

I decided to quotemark project because this is just and small component, but at the same time is a [challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U) from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). The challenge is very simple the only thing we gotta do is to the following card component as close as we can get it using the technologies we want. At the beginning seemed to easy to me to do it with React so i changed my mind to use Vue instead.

You can see the designs in the `design` directory and find the fonts, colors, and other stuffs related to the styling in the `style-guide.md` file.

Here is my solution. I used Vite, Typescript, HTML5 and CSS3

![solution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NewCastile/nft-preview-card-component/main/solution/solution.png)

```js
const getStarted = async (url) => {
	const repo = await git.clone(url)
	await yarn.run.install(repo).then((repo) => yarn.run.dev(repo))
}
```

## Easy going Vue

To be honest i didnt go for a deep dive into the framework. Of course i looked into the directives stuff and a little bit on the Composition API and some of the basic functions it offers.

At the beginning i was trying to see if could find the similarities between these and the basic hooks on React, but then i started thinking that it would be better, to not just rush the docs to find the _useState_, the _useEffect_, and the _useRef_ of Vue, because to me theres nothing more valuable than having an organic and controled learning curve with the intention of preventing any types of gaps. I know it sounds weird saying this after presenting a challenge before doing a tutorial or follow a course, but the reality is that you get a better feeling of exploring i new technology by your own with a small project than starring
at the screen watching how other people make something while they explained it (cool thing but kinda boring to me).

So what im trying to explain is, if you are starting out and you know what you are capable of, have some fun trying new things. Dont rush, dont push yourself too much, establish some limits, relax and just enjoy the moment.
